## Purpose
Star security is a security company that offers various services to clients. These services include providing security officer assistance to small and enterprise companies, on-site patrolling in specialized worksites, security monitoring and screening for specific areas such as airports and shopping centres, etc. The company has the obligation to run flawless and smooth operations. As a company, they must ensure and maintain trust and rapport with their clients. To achieve this, they need to have exceptional communication within their operations. However, running a security company with multiple clients and employees is not always a smooth sail. They run into issues on a regular basis concerning both parties of the operation. Some examples to these issues could be; 
- Security officer calling in sick an hour before their shift
- Security officer has an emergency and has to leave the jobsite ASAP
- Client does not want to work with the security officer
- Security officer does not show up to worksite
- Security officer falls asleep on the job
- Client without notification needs more security officers
The purpose of this application is to provide a software platform for the security company to manage all their issues effectively. This application aims to provide issue tracking of operations to be managed in a way that is convinient and time efficient.
